# Sample Interview Tasks

## 1. Cafe Order Checker

#### My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.

I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikes - that's not good for business!

## 2. Inflight Entertainment

#### You've built an inflight entertainment system with on-demand movie streaming.

Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending. **So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.**

## 3. Linked List Cycles

#### You have a singly-linked list and want to check if it contains a cycle.

A singly-linked list is built with nodes, where each node has:

- node.Next - the next node in the list.
- node.Value - the data held in the node. For example, if our linked list stores timestamps, node.Value might be the number of seconds since the beginning of time...jk, just past the Unix epoch.

## 4. Top Scores

#### You created a game that is more popular than Angry Birds.

Each round, players receive a score between 0 and 100, which you use to rank them from highest to lowest. So far you're using an algorithm that sorts in $`O(nlgn)`$ time, but players are complaining that their rankings aren't updated fast enough. You need a faster sorting algorithm.
